			<p>... about better pentests.</p>
			<p><a href="/table-of-contents/">Table of Contents</a></p>

			<h3>How this book can help you</h3>

			<p>Only pentesters with great technical skills can deliver great pentests. Yet they can deliver the poorest pentests.</p>

			<p>The work of pentesters happens behind closed curtains. Customers will often struggle to assess the quality of a pentest. If a client did not perceive it as positive, it wasnâ€™t a great pentest. The key to great pentests (beyond the technical part) is communication: from before the project starts until the project ends and beyond.</p>

			<p>This book will help you present, package, and deliver great pentests; and make your customers remember you as a trusted partner, recommending and hiring you again.</p>

			<p>You can implement some of the approaches of this book yourself as a pentester, in your peer group, or in your team. Others might go beyond your immediate team and must be implemented within your organization.</p>

			<p>This book is for founders of pentesting companies, for bug hunters shifting to pentesting, and for already-pentesters who want to deliver great pentests.</p>

			<h3>What this book is not about</h3>

			<p>This book will not help you to improve your technical skills. It does not deal with red teamings or bug bounty hunting.</p>
