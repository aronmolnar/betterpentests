# Want to become beta reader?

*"If you are not embarrassed by the first version of your product, youâ€™ve launched too late." (Reid Hoffman)*


I am looking for pentesters from all career stages as beta readers. No matter if you're an aspiring pentester, or highly experienced.
(The main thing is, we don't know each other: Sorry mates, you might hear my undertone. If we've met more than once: Maybe you know somebody who didn't?)

You will receive the whole book or parts of it online (for free of course).  
Everything is in draft status and still needs 2-3 rewrites; so don't spare criticism.

Beta reading is not about spotting typos.  
I am interested in:

* Where do you get confused or lost?
* Do you disagree? Do you have different experiences?
* Do parts of the book bore you? Do your thoughts wander?
* What do you find especially useful, interesting or helpful?

I need beta testers at different times.  
It might take a few weeks or months until you can get started. I hope you can wait for it.

### Interested?
